    "## Simplest case: 0-delay\n",

    "Given any arbitrary target spacing (average time between blocks), which in our case is 16s, and 0 delay, two variables control the probability of having forks:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The numer of staked coins.\n",
    "  - The time granularity used to compute block hashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Some assumptions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - There's no delay, once a block is created, it arrives immediately to all the nodes in the network.\n",
    "    Although it's intuitive to expect that higher delays could lead to higher number of forks, we'll\n",
    "    assume for now that there's no delay to have a better intuition on how other factors could affect\n",
    "    the outcome.\n",
    "  - All coins have the same denomination and each proposer holds one single coin, this is a strong (and not realistic) assumption but not very problematic.\n",
    "  - The difficulty adjustment mechanism is good enough to keep empirical probabilities close enough to the desired ones.\n",
    "  - Given that the delay is 0, and that we have a fork choice rule, the \"weakest\" forks are rapidly discarded and the nodes don't try to build chains on top of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Some definitions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - $C$ : number of staked coins\n",
    "  - $T$ : target spacing, or expected average time between blocks\n",
    "  - $m$ : in $T$ seconds a node will be able to try $m$ hashes.\n",
    "  - $P\\left(C,m,k\\right)$ : Probability that a coin gives us the ability to propose during a period of $k\\frac{T}{m}$ seconds when there are $C$ staked coins, the target spacing is $T$ and a node can try to propose every $\\frac{T}{m}$ seconds.\n",
    "  - $\\mathsf{P}$ : $P\\left(C,m,1\\right)$.\n",
    "  - $F\\left(C,m,k\\right)$ : Probability of having at least one fork during a period of $k\\frac{T}{m}$ seconds when there are $C$ staked coins, the target spacing is $T$ and a node can try to propose every $\\frac{T}{m}$ seconds.\n",
